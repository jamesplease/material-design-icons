# Material Design Icons

The _complete_ repository for Material Design Icons.

## Motivation

Google created an official [Material Design Icons repository](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons), but
they haven't updated it in a few years. There are missing icons and outstanding bugs in that project, which make it
difficult to rely on as a source of truth.

That's why I created this library. It's intended to be an up-to-date, bug-free version of the Material Design Icons.

## Installation

> I have not yet published this project to npm.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Publish to npm
- [ ] Create a React Component library from this repository
